# animationCountdown
a small animated countdown app, good for landing page loader or transition from page to page.  I plan on using this as part of a larger project that incorporates more of what I've learned along the way.

# origin
I made this app as part of a Udemy course on modern Javascript being taught by Brad Traversy.  He has a killer YouTube page called TraversyMedia that you can check out for excellent content on how to make all this stuff.
